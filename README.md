# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization---Spotify-Music-Dataset
Data Analysis and visualization using R - Spotify Music Dataset

This project aimed to analyze the top Spotify tracks using R, focusing on understanding the factors influencing a track's popularity. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, included details such as song title, artist, genre, year, beats per minute (BPM), energy, danceability, loudness, and popularity. Data cleaning involved removing irrelevant columns and rows with missing or zero values in the "Top_genre" and "Popularity" columns. Key insights included identifying the top genres in 2019, with "Latin" being the most popular, analyzing the top 10 longest tracks in the USA, and determining the most popular artists from 2011 to 2014. Visualizations such as pie charts and bar graphs were used to illustrate these findings. The analysis provided valuable insights for Spotify to enhance user experience by promoting relevant songs and improving content distribution.
